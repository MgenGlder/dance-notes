### Salsa
- Basic -> Cross body insight -> Right turn switch hands -> right turn for followers with both hands -> back and forth check -> hair comb exit -> scoop hand[^1] -> Both leader and follower turn at the same time -> open break -> go around and back of partner type check -> double right turn for follower starting on 1 and leader turn on second turn as well (scoop hand here as well).


[^1]: **Note:** Make sure to swivel your hand to a scoop, remember, swivel and scoop, like an ice cream parlor.
