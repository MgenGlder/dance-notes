### Zouk
- Basic -> Promenade (lung then left turn) -> immediately start a continuous right turn (point right foot over and inwards).
- Basic -> Latarel -> one hand -> inside turn -> press button on follower's back and continuous rotation opposite direction -> settle back -> basic or another promenade.

### Kizomba
- Basic -> another follower's saida -> bounce on left side -> right rotation while holding both hands -> step on 8 and rubber band into verdiales -> another verdiales -> follower's saida -> rotate and bounce with hip[^1].

[^1]: **Note:** We learned two variations of the bounce- one with the left hand maitaining contact, and we touch our left hand to our left shoulder, and the other without our left hand, using our hips to guide the motion.
