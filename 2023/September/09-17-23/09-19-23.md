### Cha Cha
- Cross body -> box step -> open break -> cha cha cha -> spot turn -> fwoom! on 6 (after spot turn, guide follower out of it) -> cross body -> cha cha cha -> forward after.

- Open position -> left turn prep back on 2 -> keep both hands for cuddle wrap -> unwrap for double turn into follows hammer lock -> unfurl and switch sides -> refurl (repeat as many times as you want) -> exit with double single hand turn.

### Bachata
- Progressive basic from closed -> in && out && in -> side and across -> tap in the middle and point -> 2 back, 2 forward -> double handed right turn for follow -> flick right hand during turn -> catch and flick it inside -> check turn while keeping right hand connection -> baseline to the right -> let go and basic.

### Latin Hustle
- Basic -> cross body -> left turn to left of follower -> Step behind and slide hand to back for immediate cross body -> hold the follower's right waist with left hand, grab left hand with right hand -> turn follower left, lower hand on second turn for hammerlock -> unwind and follow the follower left -> turn left double again like before (hand on waist, hand on hand) -> on last, grab left and lift above shoulder, hold waist and lead a free spin.
